# Ascend NPU Custom Ops Build

AFD CAMP2P depends on plugin-owned Ascend custom operators for
Attention-to-Expert and Expert-to-Attention transfers:

- `torch.ops.afd_ascend.a2e`
- `torch.ops.afd_ascend.e2a`

The NPU native sources live in this directory:

```text
csrc/npu/a2e
csrc/npu/e2a
csrc/npu/aclnn_torch_adapter
csrc/npu/torch_extension
```

## Default Behavior

Local CPU and macOS development does not build Ascend custom ops by default.
The Python package remains import-safe unless the Ascend build is explicitly
enabled.

## Build In An Ascend Environment

Install the package with Ascend custom ops enabled:

```bash
AFD_BUILD_ASCEND_OPS=1 \
SOC_VERSION=910c \
pip install -e .
```

Common environment variables:

- `ASCEND_HOME_PATH`: CANN toolkit path. Defaults to
  `/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest`.
- `TORCH_NPU_PATH`: optional path to the `torch_npu` package.
- `SOC_VERSION`: `910c`, `ascend910_93*`, and `ascend910_9392` build
  `a2e;e2a`.
- `MAX_JOBS`: number of parallel CMake build jobs for the PyTorch extension.
- `AFD_SKIP_ACLNN_BUILD=1`: skip rebuilding the ACLNN operator package and
  build the PyTorch extension against an existing custom-op installation.

The setup flow calls:

```text
csrc/npu/build_aclnn.sh
csrc/npu/build.sh
```

The generated artifacts are installed into the Python package:

```text
afd_plugin/_C_ascend*.so
afd_plugin/_cann_ops_custom/
```

## vLLM-Ascend Coexistence

AFD custom ops must coexist with vLLM-Ascend in the same process:

- The Python extension is owned by this plugin package, for example
  `afd_plugin._C_ascend`.
- A2E/E2A are registered under `torch.ops.afd_ascend`, not under
  vLLM-Ascend's `torch.ops._C_ascend` namespace.
- The CANN custom-op package is installed under the AFD vendor path,
  `afd_plugin/_cann_ops_custom/vendors/afd-plugin/...`.
- The loader uses the package-local `libcust_opapi.so` path through
  `AFD_CUST_OPAPI_LIB_PATH`; it must not rely on a bare
  `dlopen("libcust_opapi.so")`.

Load the extension at runtime with:

```python
from afd_plugin.compat.ascend import ensure_afd_ascend_ops_loaded

ensure_afd_ascend_ops_loaded()
```

## Current Scope

This build path covers the AFD A2E/E2A operators required by the first CAMP2P
connector path. Multi-stream, quantized, ACL graph, and gate-on-attention paths
are handled separately.
